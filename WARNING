WARNING

Due to a bug in the boundary conditions, versions prior and including 1.2.x are not suitable for the Jackson 2014 Benchmark exercise.

Prior to version 1.6.0, the spherical harmonic coefficients were unnormalised. After and including 1.6.0 the spherical harmonic coefficients are normalized to 4Pi.
See the manual to see what this means. The code is able to recognise and correctly interpret both old and new coefficients via the MAGIC numbers,
again, see the manual to understand what this means.

Prior to version 1.7.0 there was a bug in the internal sources profiles. The derivatives had the wrong sign.
!!!YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!
