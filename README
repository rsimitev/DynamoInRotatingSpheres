# Brief description
 
This is a computer code for numerical simulations of
thermo-compositional convection and of convection driven dynamos in
rotating spherical shells for the purposes of mathematical modelling
of the geodynamo, planetary and stellar dynamos.

# History of development

The idea and early mathematical formulations were conceived by Friedrich
H Busse (University of Bayreuth) at around 1996. Early versions of
the code were developed by Tilgner, at the time a PostDoc with
Busse, and by Ardes, a student in that research group. Grote
used with the code in relation to his PhD dissertation (Bayreuth,
2000). Simitev also used the code for his PhD dissertation (Bayreuth,
2004), and then maintained, modified, and used the code
extensively. Silva ported the code to Fortran 95 and linked to open
source libraries, and prepared the documentation (2014-16).

# Details

## DEPENDENCIES
We use cmake version 2.6-patch 4 as the build system.
We depend on FFTW version 3.2.1. Not tested with any other versions.
We use OpenMPI 1.6 (at least) for the parallel version. The binary wrappers must be in your $PATH and the libraries in your $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
Online documentation can be built using doxygen >= 1.6.1

## Building the online documentation
mkdir BUILD
cd BUILD
cmake ..
make doc

The code documentation can then be found by pointing a browser to BUILD/APIDOX/index.html

## COMPILATION (sequential)
mkdir BUILD
cd BUILD
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${HOME} ..
make && make install

## COMPILATION (parallel)
mkdir BUILD
cd BUILD
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${HOME} -DMPI=ON ..
make && make install

After all run successfully, the file drs.exe should be in "${HOME}/bin/".
