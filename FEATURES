This is a list of features that were added relatively to the original code.
* Modular design.
* Use cmake as a build tool.
* Off-tree compilation: keep the source code clean ;) .
* Automatic packaging of source or pre-compiled binaries.
* Fourier transforms using FFTW3.
* Legendre polynomials from SHTOOLS.
* Variable time-step selectable at run-time.
* Stopping condition on cpu-time.
* Stopping condition on lock-file removal.
* Resolution of computation is independent of resolution of inputs.
* MPI details of the parallel implementation fully abstracted from the main code.
* Online documentation with doxygen and CMake.
* Also save the periodically saved quantities after the last step.
* Added pseudo-vacuum magnetic boundary conditions.
* Double diffusive convection.
* Most of the code is now compiled into a library for reuse.
* Utilities based on the above library.
* User handbook.
* Rendering using IDL
* Rendering using OpenDX
