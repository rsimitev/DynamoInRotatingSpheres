integer function PlmIndex(l,m)
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!
!>       This function will return the index corresponding
!!       to a given l and m in the arrays of Legendre Polynomials
!!       generated by routines such as PlmBar and PlmSchmidt.
!!
!!       Calling Parameters:
!!              l       Spherical harmonic angular degree.
!!              m       Spherical harmonic angular order.
!!
!!       Dependencies:       None
