This is a set of codes for numerical simulation of nonlinear
thermo-compositional convection and of convection-driven dynamos in
rotating spherical shells. The code has been benchmarked (Matsui et
al 2016) and has been used extensively for modelling of geodynamo,
planetary and stellar dynamos (see references in https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2207-5789). 

The main numerical code uses a pseudo-spectral spatial discretisation,
see (Tilgner 1999). The idea and early mathematical formulations were
conceived by Busse. Early implementations were done by Tilgner, Ardes
and Grote. Simitev maintained, modified, and used the code extensively,
including introduction of a governing equation for the
concentration within the project acknowledged below. Silva ported the
code to Fortran 95 and open source libraries, and prepared the
documentation (2014-16).
