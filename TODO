List of features to implement in arbitrary order.

* Implement MCNAB instead of CNAB for the time-stepping for better stability.
* Rewrite the temperature adimensionalization such that the top to bottom adimensional 
  temperature difference is always 1 in adimensional units.
* Write a proper benchmark test pack:
 - provide program that returns true if all of the quantities for the benchmark are within 1% of the reference values;
 - test all the cases of Jones et al. 2001;
 - test all the cases of Jackson et al.;
 - Write a benchmark mode using the debug module and facilities;
* Input/Output in netcdf format;
* Concurrent I/O;
* Parallell evaluation of the several equations;
* Optimization of the array index in spectral space;
* Output of intermediate state-files;
* User defined temperature and composition profiles.
* User defined lateraly variable boundary conditions;
* Topography?
* Documentation:
  - Document headers for all functions and subroutines;
  - Document the utilities;
* Figure out a way to reduce the usage of #ifdef COMP      

DONE
* Write a proper benchmark test pack:
 - provide initial conditions;
